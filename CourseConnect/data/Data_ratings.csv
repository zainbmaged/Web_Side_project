Modern approaches to seismic design and retrofit will be covered through case studies of some unique campus buildings in Tokyo. The course starts by introducing the progression of structural design from traditional timber buildings to the first steel high rise structures, metabolism movement and the evolution of modern spatial structures in Japan. Concepts like ‘Integrated Facade Engineering’ and ‘Grid-skin structures’ are discussed and illustrated through case studies of Tokyo-Tech campus buildings wherein seismic performance was enhanced sustainably while considering the environmental performance and aesthetics. In addition, a number of 360-degree videos of Tokyo Tech buildings provide learners with an immersive experience. The application of the grid-skin concept to RC buildings is discussed using shear walls and a two-layer framing system. Modern response control strategies to achieve immediate occupancy post-earthquake like rocking frame systems and seismic isolation in steel buildings are covered and practical considerations while adopting these systems are explained through the design of campus buildings. Grid shell systems and their unique seismic response characteristics are explained. The design of the metro station near campus was used to explain the practical and technical difficulties of designing lightweight roofs. Finally, the importance of collaboration between structural engineers and architects is discussed in a number of interviews between ETH Zurich’s Prof. L. Stalder, Tokyo Tech’s Prof. T.

The course starts by introducing the progression of structural design from traditional timber buildings to the first steel high rise structures, metabolism movement and the evolution of modern spatial structures in Japan. Concepts like ‘Integrated Facade Engineering’ and ‘Grid-skin structures’ are discussed and illustrated through case studies of Tokyo-Tech campus buildings wherein seismic performance was enhanced sustainably while considering the environmental performance and aesthetics. In addition, a number of 360-degree videos of Tokyo Tech buildings provide learners with an immersive experience. The application of the grid-skin concept to RC buildings is discussed using shear walls and a two-layer framing system. Modern response control strategies to achieve immediate occupancy post-earthquake like rocking frame systems and seismic isolation in steel buildings are covered and practical considerations while adopting these systems are explained through the design of campus buildings. Grid shell systems and their unique seismic response characteristics are explained. The design of the metro station near campus was used to explain the practical and technical difficulties of designing lightweight roofs. Finally, the importance of collaboration between structural engineers and architects is discussed in a number of interviews between ETH Zurich’s Prof. L. Stalder, Tokyo Tech’s Prof. T.

Modern approaches to seismic design and retrofit will be covered through case studies of some unique campus buildings in Tokyo. The course starts by introducing the progression of structural design from traditional timber buildings to the first steel high rise structures, metabolism movement and the evolution of modern spatial structures in Japan. Concepts like ‘Integrated Facade Engineering’ and ‘Grid-skin structures’ are discussed and illustrated through case studies of Tokyo-Tech campus buildings wherein seismic performance was enhanced sustainably while considering the environmental performance and aesthetics. In addition, a number of 360-degree videos of Tokyo Tech buildings provide learners with an immersive experience. The application of the grid-skin concept to RC buildings is discussed using shear walls and a two-layer framing system. Modern response control strategies to achieve immediate occupancy post-earthquake like rocking frame systems and seismic isolation in steel buildings are covered and practical considerations while adopting these systems are explained through the design of campus buildings. Grid shell systems and their unique seismic response characteristics are explained. The design of the metro station near campus was used to explain the practical and technical difficulties of designing lightweight roofs. Finally, the importance of collaboration between structural engineers and architects is discussed in a number of interviews between ETH Zurich’s Prof. L. Stalder, Tokyo Tech’s Prof. T.

Modern approaches to seismic design and retrofit will be covered through case studies of some unique campus buildings in Tokyo. The course starts by introducing the progression of structural design from traditional timber buildings to the first steel high rise structures, metabolism movement and the evolution of modern spatial structures in Japan. Concepts like ‘Integrated Facade Engineering’ and ‘Grid-skin structures’ are discussed and illustrated through case studies of Tokyo-Tech campus buildings wherein seismic performance was enhanced sustainably while considering the environmental performance and aesthetics. In addition, a number of 360-degree videos of Tokyo Tech buildings provide learners with an immersive experience. The application of the grid-skin concept to RC buildings is discussed using shear walls and a two-layer framing system. Modern response control strategies to achieve immediate occupancy post-earthquake like rocking frame systems and seismic isolation in steel buildings are covered and practical considerations while adopting these systems are explained through the design of campus buildings. Grid shell systems and their unique seismic response characteristics are explained. The design of the metro station near campus was used to explain the practical and technical difficulties of designing lightweight roofs. Finally, the importance of collaboration between structural engineers and architects is discussed in a number of interviews between ETH Zurich’s Prof. L. Stalder, Tokyo Tech’s Prof. T.

Modern approaches to seismic design and retrofit will be covered through case studies of some unique campus buildings in Tokyo. The course starts by introducing the progression of structural design from traditional timber buildings to the first steel high rise structures, metabolism movement and the evolution of modern spatial structures in Japan. Concepts like ‘Integrated Facade Engineering’ and ‘Grid-skin structures’ are discussed and illustrated through case studies of Tokyo-Tech campus buildings wherein seismic performance was enhanced sustainably while considering the environmental performance and aesthetics. In addition, a number of 360-degree videos of Tokyo Tech buildings provide learners with an immersive experience. The application of the grid-skin concept to RC buildings is discussed using shear walls and a two-layer framing system. Modern response control strategies to achieve immediate occupancy post-earthquake like rocking frame systems and seismic isolation in steel buildings are covered and practical considerations while adopting these systems are explained through the design of campus buildings. Grid shell systems and their unique seismic response characteristics are explained. The design of the metro station near campus was used to explain the practical and technical difficulties of designing lightweight roofs. Finally, the importance of collaboration between structural engineers and architects is discussed in a number of interviews between ETH Zurich’s Prof. L. Stalder, Tokyo Tech’s Prof. T.

Concepts like ‘Integrated Facade Engineering’ and ‘Grid-skin structures’ are discussed and illustrated through case studies of Tokyo-Tech campus buildings wherein seismic performance was enhanced sustainably while considering the environmental performance and aesthetics. In addition, a number of 360-degree videos of Tokyo Tech buildings provide learners with an immersive experience. The application of the grid-skin concept to RC buildings is discussed using shear walls and a two-layer framing system. Modern response control strategies to achieve immediate occupancy post-earthquake like rocking frame systems and seismic isolation in steel buildings are covered and practical considerations while adopting these systems are explained through the design of campus buildings. Grid shell systems and their unique seismic response characteristics are explained. The design of the metro station near campus was used to explain the practical and technical difficulties of designing lightweight roofs.

Concepts like ‘Integrated Facade Engineering’ and ‘Grid-skin structures’ are discussed and illustrated through case studies of Tokyo-Tech campus buildings wherein seismic performance was enhanced sustainably while considering the environmental performance and aesthetics. In addition, a number of 360-degree videos of Tokyo Tech buildings provide learners with an immersive experience. The application of the grid-skin concept to RC buildings is discussed using shear walls and a two-layer framing system. Modern response control strategies to achieve immediate occupancy post-earthquake like rocking frame systems and seismic isolation in steel buildings are covered and practical considerations while adopting these systems are explained through the design of campus buildings. Grid shell systems and their unique seismic response characteristics are explained. The design of the metro station near campus was used to explain the practical and technical difficulties of designing lightweight roofs.

The course starts by introducing the progression of structural design from traditional timber buildings to the first steel high rise structures, metabolism movement and the evolution of modern spatial structures in Japan. Concepts like ‘Integrated Facade Engineering’ and ‘Grid-skin structures’ are discussed and illustrated through case studies of Tokyo-Tech campus buildings wherein seismic performance was enhanced sustainably while considering the environmental performance and aesthetics. In addition, a number of 360-degree videos of Tokyo Tech buildings provide learners with an immersive experience. The application of the grid-skin concept to RC buildings is discussed using shear walls and a two-layer framing system. Modern response control strategies to achieve immediate occupancy post-earthquake like rocking frame systems and seismic isolation in steel buildings are covered and practical considerations while adopting these systems are explained through the design of campus buildings. Grid shell systems and their unique seismic response characteristics are explained. The design of the metro station near campus was used to explain the practical and technical difficulties of designing lightweight roofs. Finally, the importance of collaboration between structural engineers and architects is discussed in a number of interviews between ETH Zurich’s Prof. L. Stalder, Tokyo Tech’s Prof. T. Takeuchi and Prof. Y. Tsukamoto.",edX,Available for Paid verified track with cost $79 USD,5 weeks 1–3 hours per week,Course,"17,766 already enrolled!

Concepts like ‘Integrated Facade Engineering’ and ‘Grid-skin structures’ are discussed and illustrated through case studies of Tokyo-Tech campus buildings wherein seismic performance was enhanced sustainably while considering the environmental performance and aesthetics. In addition, a number of 360-degree videos of Tokyo Tech buildings provide learners with an immersive experience. The application of the grid-skin concept to RC buildings is discussed using shear walls and a two-layer framing system. Modern response control strategies to achieve immediate occupancy post-earthquake like rocking frame systems and seismic isolation in steel buildings are covered and practical considerations while adopting these systems are explained through the design of campus buildings. Grid shell systems and their unique seismic response characteristics are explained. The design of the metro station near campus was used to explain the practical and technical difficulties of designing lightweight roofs.

The course starts by introducing the progression of structural design from traditional timber buildings to the first steel high rise structures, metabolism movement and the evolution of modern spatial structures in Japan. Concepts like ‘Integrated Facade Engineering’ and ‘Grid-skin structures’ are discussed and illustrated through case studies of Tokyo-Tech campus buildings wherein seismic performance was enhanced sustainably while considering the environmental performance and aesthetics. In addition, a number of 360-degree videos of Tokyo Tech buildings provide learners with an immersive experience. The application of the grid-skin concept to RC buildings is discussed using shear walls and a two-layer framing system. Modern response control strategies to achieve immediate occupancy post-earthquake like rocking frame systems and seismic isolation in steel buildings are covered and practical considerations while adopting these systems are explained through the design of campus buildings. Grid shell systems and their unique seismic response characteristics are explained. The design of the metro station near campus was used to explain the practical and technical difficulties of designing lightweight roofs.

The course starts by introducing the progression of structural design from traditional timber buildings to the first steel high rise structures, metabolism movement and the evolution of modern spatial structures in Japan. Concepts like ‘Integrated Facade Engineering’ and ‘Grid-skin structures’ are discussed and illustrated through case studies of Tokyo-Tech campus buildings wherein seismic performance was enhanced sustainably while considering the environmental performance and aesthetics. In addition, a number of 360-degree videos of Tokyo Tech buildings provide learners with an immersive experience. The application of the grid-skin concept to RC buildings is discussed using shear walls and a two-layer framing system. Modern response control strategies to achieve immediate occupancy post-earthquake like rocking frame systems and seismic isolation in steel buildings are covered and practical considerations while adopting these systems are explained through the design of campus buildings. Grid shell systems and their unique seismic response characteristics are explained. The design of the metro station near campus was used to explain the practical and technical difficulties of designing lightweight roofs.

The course starts by introducing the progression of structural design from traditional timber buildings to the first steel high rise structures, metabolism movement and the evolution of modern spatial structures in Japan. Concepts like ‘Integrated Facade Engineering’ and ‘Grid-skin structures’ are discussed and illustrated through case studies of Tokyo-Tech campus buildings wherein seismic performance was enhanced sustainably while considering the environmental performance and aesthetics. In addition, a number of 360-degree videos of Tokyo Tech buildings provide learners with an immersive experience. The application of the grid-skin concept to RC buildings is discussed using shear walls and a two-layer framing system. Modern response control strategies to achieve immediate occupancy post-earthquake like rocking frame systems and seismic isolation in steel buildings are covered and practical considerations while adopting these systems are explained through the design of campus buildings. Grid shell systems and their unique seismic response characteristics are explained. The design of the metro station near campus was used to explain the practical and technical difficulties of designing lightweight roofs.

Concepts like ‘Integrated Facade Engineering’ and ‘Grid-skin structures’ are discussed and illustrated through case studies of Tokyo-Tech campus buildings wherein seismic performance was enhanced sustainably while considering the environmental performance and aesthetics. In addition, a number of 360-degree videos of Tokyo Tech buildings provide learners with an immersive experience. The application of the grid-skin concept to RC buildings is discussed using shear walls and a two-layer framing system. Modern response control strategies to achieve immediate occupancy post-earthquake like rocking frame systems and seismic isolation in steel buildings are covered and practical considerations while adopting these systems are explained through the design of campus buildings. Grid shell systems and their unique seismic response characteristics are explained. The design of the metro station near campus was used to explain the practical and technical difficulties of designing lightweight roofs.

Modern approaches to seismic design and retrofit will be covered through case studies of some unique campus buildings in Tokyo. The course starts by introducing the progression of structural design from traditional timber buildings to the first steel high rise structures, metabolism movement and the evolution of modern spatial structures in Japan. Concepts like ‘Integrated Facade Engineering’ and ‘Grid-skin structures’ are discussed and illustrated through case studies of Tokyo-Tech campus buildings wherein seismic performance was enhanced sustainably while considering the environmental performance and aesthetics. In addition, a number of 360-degree videos of Tokyo Tech buildings provide learners with an immersive experience. The application of the grid-skin concept to RC buildings is discussed using shear walls and a two-layer framing system. Modern response control strategies to achieve immediate occupancy post-earthquake like rocking frame systems and seismic isolation in steel buildings are covered and practical considerations while adopting these systems are explained through the design of campus buildings. Grid shell systems and their unique seismic response characteristics are explained. The design of the metro station near campus was used to explain the practical and technical difficulties of designing lightweight roofs. Finally, the importance of collaboration between structural engineers and architects is discussed in a number of interviews between ETH Zurich’s Prof. L. Stalder, Tokyo Tech’s Prof. T.

Concepts like ‘Integrated Facade Engineering’ and ‘Grid-skin structures’ are discussed and illustrated through case studies of Tokyo-Tech campus buildings wherein seismic performance was enhanced sustainably while considering the environmental performance and aesthetics. In addition, a number of 360-degree videos of Tokyo Tech buildings provide learners with an immersive experience. The application of the grid-skin concept to RC buildings is discussed using shear walls and a two-layer framing system. Modern response control strategies to achieve immediate occupancy post-earthquake like rocking frame systems and seismic isolation in steel buildings are covered and practical considerations while adopting these systems are explained through the design of campus buildings. Grid shell systems and their unique seismic response characteristics are explained. The design of the metro station near campus was used to explain the practical and technical difficulties of designing lightweight roofs.

Concepts like ‘Integrated Facade Engineering’ and ‘Grid-skin structures’ are discussed and illustrated through case studies of Tokyo-Tech campus buildings wherein seismic performance was enhanced sustainably while considering the environmental performance and aesthetics. In addition, a number of 360-degree videos of Tokyo Tech buildings provide learners with an immersive experience. The application of the grid-skin concept to RC buildings is discussed using shear walls and a two-layer framing system. Modern response control strategies to achieve immediate occupancy post-earthquake like rocking frame systems and seismic isolation in steel buildings are covered and practical considerations while adopting these systems are explained through the design of campus buildings. Grid shell systems and their unique seismic response characteristics are explained. The design of the metro station near campus was used to explain the practical and technical difficulties of designing lightweight roofs.

Concepts like ‘Integrated Facade Engineering’ and ‘Grid-skin structures’ are discussed and illustrated through case studies of Tokyo-Tech campus buildings wherein seismic performance was enhanced sustainably while considering the environmental performance and aesthetics. In addition, a number of 360-degree videos of Tokyo Tech buildings provide learners with an immersive experience. The application of the grid-skin concept to RC buildings is discussed using shear walls and a two-layer framing system. Modern response control strategies to achieve immediate occupancy post-earthquake like rocking frame systems and seismic isolation in steel buildings are covered and practical considerations while adopting these systems are explained through the design of campus buildings. Grid shell systems and their unique seismic response characteristics are explained. The design of the metro station near campus was used to explain the practical and technical difficulties of designing lightweight roofs. Finally, the importance of collaboration between structural engineers and architects is discussed in a number of interviews between ETH Zurich’s Prof. L. Stalder, Tokyo Tech’s Prof. T.

Concepts like ‘Integrated Facade Engineering’ and ‘Grid-skin structures’ are discussed and illustrated through case studies of Tokyo-Tech campus buildings wherein seismic performance was enhanced sustainably while considering the environmental performance and aesthetics. In addition, a number of 360-degree videos of Tokyo Tech buildings provide learners with an immersive experience. The application of the grid-skin concept to RC buildings is discussed using shear walls and a two-layer framing system. Modern response control strategies to achieve immediate occupancy post-earthquake like rocking frame systems and seismic isolation in steel buildings are covered and practical considerations while adopting these systems are explained through the design of campus buildings. Grid shell systems and their unique seismic response characteristics are explained. The design of the metro station near campus was used to explain the practical and technical difficulties of designing lightweight roofs.

Modern approaches to seismic design and retrofit will be covered through case studies of some unique campus buildings in Tokyo. The course starts by introducing the progression of structural design from traditional timber buildings to the first steel high rise structures, metabolism movement and the evolution of modern spatial structures in Japan. Concepts like ‘Integrated Facade Engineering’ and ‘Grid-skin structures’ are discussed and illustrated through case studies of Tokyo-Tech campus buildings wherein seismic performance was enhanced sustainably while considering the environmental performance and aesthetics. In addition, a number of 360-degree videos of Tokyo Tech buildings provide learners with an immersive experience. The application of the grid-skin concept to RC buildings is discussed using shear walls and a two-layer framing system. Modern response control strategies to achieve immediate occupancy post-earthquake like rocking frame systems and seismic isolation in steel buildings are covered and practical considerations while adopting these systems are explained through the design of campus buildings. Grid shell systems and their unique seismic response characteristics are explained. The design of the metro station near campus was used to explain the practical and technical difficulties of designing lightweight roofs. Finally, the importance of collaboration between structural engineers and architects is discussed in a number of interviews between ETH Zurich’s Prof. L. Stalder, Tokyo Tech’s Prof. T.

Concepts like ‘Integrated Facade Engineering’ and ‘Grid-skin structures’ are discussed and illustrated through case studies of Tokyo-Tech campus buildings wherein seismic performance was enhanced sustainably while considering the environmental performance and aesthetics. In addition, a number of 360-degree videos of Tokyo Tech buildings provide learners with an immersive experience. The application of the grid-skin concept to RC buildings is discussed using shear walls and a two-layer framing system. Modern response control strategies to achieve immediate occupancy post-earthquake like rocking frame systems and seismic isolation in steel buildings are covered and practical considerations while adopting these systems are explained through the design of campus buildings. Grid shell systems and their unique seismic response characteristics are explained. The design of the metro station near campus was used to explain the practical and technical difficulties of designing lightweight roofs.

Concepts like ‘Integrated Facade Engineering’ and ‘Grid-skin structures’ are discussed and illustrated through case studies of Tokyo-Tech campus buildings wherein seismic performance was enhanced sustainably while considering the environmental performance and aesthetics. In addition, a number of 360-degree videos of Tokyo Tech buildings provide learners with an immersive experience. The application of the grid-skin concept to RC buildings is discussed using shear walls and a two-layer framing system. Modern response control strategies to achieve immediate occupancy post-earthquake like rocking frame systems and seismic isolation in steel buildings are covered and practical considerations while adopting these systems are explained through the design of campus buildings. Grid shell systems and their unique seismic response characteristics are explained. The design of the metro station near campus was used to explain the practical and technical difficulties of designing lightweight roofs. Finally, the importance of collaboration between structural engineers and architects is discussed in a number of interviews between ETH Zurich’s Prof. L. Stalder, Tokyo Tech’s Prof. T.

Concepts like ‘Integrated Facade Engineering’ and ‘Grid-skin structures’ are discussed and illustrated through case studies of Tokyo-Tech campus buildings wherein seismic performance was enhanced sustainably while considering the environmental performance and aesthetics. In addition, a number of 360-degree videos of Tokyo Tech buildings provide learners with an immersive experience. The application of the grid-skin concept to RC buildings is discussed using shear walls and a two-layer framing system. Modern response control strategies to achieve immediate occupancy post-earthquake like rocking frame systems and seismic isolation in steel buildings are covered and practical considerations while adopting these systems are explained through the design of campus buildings. Grid shell systems and their unique seismic response characteristics are explained. The design of the metro station near campus was used to explain the practical and technical difficulties of designing lightweight roofs.

Concepts like ‘Integrated Facade Engineering’ and ‘Grid-skin structures’ are discussed and illustrated through case studies of Tokyo-Tech campus buildings wherein seismic performance was enhanced sustainably while considering the environmental performance and aesthetics. In addition, a number of 360-degree videos of Tokyo Tech buildings provide learners with an immersive experience. The application of the grid-skin concept to RC buildings is discussed using shear walls and a two-layer framing system. Modern response control strategies to achieve immediate occupancy post-earthquake like rocking frame systems and seismic isolation in steel buildings are covered and practical considerations while adopting these systems are explained through the design of campus buildings. Grid shell systems and their unique seismic response characteristics are explained. The design of the metro station near campus was used to explain the practical and technical difficulties of designing lightweight roofs.

Concepts like ‘Integrated Facade Engineering’ and ‘Grid-skin structures’ are discussed and illustrated through case studies of Tokyo-Tech campus buildings wherein seismic performance was enhanced sustainably while considering the environmental performance and aesthetics. In addition, a number of 360-degree videos of Tokyo Tech buildings provide learners with an immersive experience. The application of the grid-skin concept to RC buildings is discussed using shear walls and a two-layer framing system. Modern response control strategies to achieve immediate occupancy post-earthquake like rocking frame systems and seismic isolation in steel buildings are covered and practical considerations while adopting these systems are explained through the design of campus buildings. Grid shell systems and their unique seismic response characteristics are explained. The design of the metro station near campus was used to explain the practical and technical difficulties of designing lightweight roofs. Finally, the importance of collaboration between structural engineers and architects is discussed in a number of interviews between ETH Zurich’s Prof. L. Stalder, Tokyo Tech’s Prof. T.

The course starts by introducing the progression of structural design from traditional timber buildings to the first steel high rise structures, metabolism movement and the evolution of modern spatial structures in Japan. Concepts like ‘Integrated Facade Engineering’ and ‘Grid-skin structures’ are discussed and illustrated through case studies of Tokyo-Tech campus buildings wherein seismic performance was enhanced sustainably while considering the environmental performance and aesthetics. In addition, a number of 360-degree videos of Tokyo Tech buildings provide learners with an immersive experience. The application of the grid-skin concept to RC buildings is discussed using shear walls and a two-layer framing system. Modern response control strategies to achieve immediate occupancy post-earthquake like rocking frame systems and seismic isolation in steel buildings are covered and practical considerations while adopting these systems are explained through the design of campus buildings. Grid shell systems and their unique seismic response characteristics are explained. The design of the metro station near campus was used to explain the practical and technical difficulties of designing lightweight roofs.

Concepts like ‘Integrated Facade Engineering’ and ‘Grid-skin structures’ are discussed and illustrated through case studies of Tokyo-Tech campus buildings wherein seismic performance was enhanced sustainably while considering the environmental performance and aesthetics. In addition, a number of 360-degree videos of Tokyo Tech buildings provide learners with an immersive experience. The application of the grid-skin concept to RC buildings is discussed using shear walls and a two-layer framing system. Modern response control strategies to achieve immediate occupancy post-earthquake like rocking frame systems and seismic isolation in steel buildings are covered and practical considerations while adopting these systems are explained through the design of campus buildings. Grid shell systems and their unique seismic response characteristics are explained. The design of the metro station near campus was used to explain the practical and technical difficulties of designing lightweight roofs. Finally, the importance of collaboration between structural engineers and architects is discussed in a number of interviews between ETH Zurich’s Prof. L. Stalder, Tokyo Tech’s Prof. T.

The course starts by introducing the progression of structural design from traditional timber buildings to the first steel high rise structures, metabolism movement and the evolution of modern spatial structures in Japan. Concepts like ‘Integrated Facade Engineering’ and ‘Grid-skin structures’ are discussed and illustrated through case studies of Tokyo-Tech campus buildings wherein seismic performance was enhanced sustainably while considering the environmental performance and aesthetics. In addition, a number of 360-degree videos of Tokyo Tech buildings provide learners with an immersive experience. The application of the grid-skin concept to RC buildings is discussed using shear walls and a two-layer framing system. Modern response control strategies to achieve immediate occupancy post-earthquake like rocking frame systems and seismic isolation in steel buildings are covered and practical considerations while adopting these systems are explained through the design of campus buildings. Grid shell systems and their unique seismic response characteristics are explained. The design of the metro station near campus was used to explain the practical and technical difficulties of designing lightweight roofs. Finally, the importance of collaboration between structural engineers and architects is discussed in a number of interviews between ETH Zurich’s Prof. L. Stalder, Tokyo Tech’s Prof. T.

Grid shell systems and their unique seismic response characteristics are explained. The design of the metro station near campus was used to explain the practical and technical difficulties of designing lightweight roofs.

Concepts like ‘Integrated Facade Engineering’ and ‘Grid-skin structures’ are discussed and illustrated through case studies of Tokyo-Tech campus buildings wherein seismic performance was enhanced sustainably while considering the environmental performance and aesthetics. In addition, a number of 360-degree videos of Tokyo Tech buildings provide learners with an immersive experience. The application of the grid-skin concept to RC buildings is discussed using shear walls and a two-layer framing system. Modern response control strategies to achieve immediate occupancy post-earthquake like rocking frame systems and seismic isolation in steel buildings are covered and practical considerations while adopting these systems are explained through the design of campus buildings. Grid shell systems and their unique seismic response characteristics are explained. The design of the metro station near campus was used to explain the practical and technical difficulties of designing lightweight roofs.

Concepts like ‘Integrated Facade Engineering’ and ‘Grid-skin structures’ are discussed and illustrated through case studies of Tokyo-Tech campus buildings wherein seismic performance was enhanced sustainably while considering the environmental performance and aesthetics. In addition, a number of 360-degree videos of Tokyo Tech buildings provide learners with an immersive experience. The application of the grid-skin concept to RC buildings is discussed using shear walls and a two-layer framing system. Modern response control strategies to achieve immediate occupancy post-earthquake like rocking frame systems and seismic isolation in steel buildings are covered and practical considerations while adopting these systems are explained through the design of campus buildings. Grid shell systems and their unique seismic response characteristics are explained. The design of the metro station near campus was used to explain the practical and technical difficulties of designing lightweight roofs.

Modern approaches to seismic design and retrofit will be covered through case studies of some unique campus buildings in Tokyo. The course starts by introducing the progression of structural design from traditional timber buildings to the first steel high rise structures, metabolism movement and the evolution of modern spatial structures in Japan. Concepts like ‘Integrated Facade Engineering’ and ‘Grid-skin structures’ are discussed and illustrated through case studies of Tokyo-Tech campus buildings wherein seismic performance was enhanced sustainably while considering the environmental performance and aesthetics. In addition, a number of 360-degree videos of Tokyo Tech buildings provide learners with an immersive experience. The application of the grid-skin concept to RC buildings is discussed using shear walls and a two-layer framing system. Modern response control strategies to achieve immediate occupancy post-earthquake like rocking frame systems and seismic isolation in steel buildings are covered and practical considerations while adopting these systems are explained through the design of campus buildings. Grid shell systems and their unique seismic response characteristics are explained. The design of the metro station near campus was used to explain the practical and technical difficulties of designing lightweight roofs. Finally, the importance of collaboration between structural engineers and architects is discussed in a number of interviews between ETH Zurich’s Prof. L. Stalder, Tokyo Tech’s Prof. T. Takeuchi and Prof. Y. Tsukamoto.",edX,Available for Paid verified track with cost $79 USD,5 weeks 1–3 hours per week,Course,"17,766 already enrolled!

Concepts like ‘Integrated Facade Engineering’ and ‘Grid-skin structures’ are discussed and illustrated through case studies of Tokyo-Tech campus buildings wherein seismic performance was enhanced sustainably while considering the environmental performance and aesthetics. In addition, a number of 360-degree videos of Tokyo Tech buildings provide learners with an immersive experience. The application of the grid-skin concept to RC buildings is discussed using shear walls and a two-layer framing system. Modern response control strategies to achieve immediate occupancy post-earthquake like rocking frame systems and seismic isolation in steel buildings are covered and practical considerations while adopting these systems are explained through the design of campus buildings. Grid shell systems and their unique seismic response characteristics are explained. The design of the metro station near campus was used to explain the practical and technical difficulties of designing lightweight roofs.

The course starts by introducing the progression of structural design from traditional timber buildings to the first steel high rise structures, metabolism movement and the evolution of modern spatial structures in Japan. Concepts like ‘Integrated Facade Engineering’ and ‘Grid-skin structures’ are discussed and illustrated through case studies of Tokyo-Tech campus buildings wherein seismic performance was enhanced sustainably while considering the environmental performance and aesthetics. In addition, a number of 360-degree videos of Tokyo Tech buildings provide learners with an immersive experience. The application of the grid-skin concept to RC buildings is discussed using shear walls and a two-layer framing system. Modern response control strategies to achieve immediate occupancy post-earthquake like rocking frame systems and seismic isolation in steel buildings are covered and practical considerations while adopting these systems are explained through the design of campus buildings. Grid shell systems and their unique seismic response characteristics are explained. The design of the metro station near campus was used to explain the practical and technical difficulties of designing lightweight roofs. Finally, the importance of collaboration between structural engineers and architects is discussed in a number of interviews between ETH Zurich’s Prof. L. Stalder, Tokyo Tech’s Prof. T.

Concepts like ‘Integrated Facade Engineering’ and ‘Grid-skin structures’ are discussed and illustrated through case studies of Tokyo-Tech campus buildings wherein seismic performance was enhanced sustainably while considering the environmental performance and aesthetics. In addition, a number of 360-degree videos of Tokyo Tech buildings provide learners with an immersive experience. The application of the grid-skin concept to RC buildings is discussed using shear walls and a two-layer framing system. Modern response control strategies to achieve immediate occupancy post-earthquake like rocking frame systems and seismic isolation in steel buildings are covered and practical considerations while adopting these systems are explained through the design of campus buildings. Grid shell systems and their unique seismic response characteristics are explained. The design of the metro station near campus was used to explain the practical and technical difficulties of designing lightweight roofs.

Concepts like ‘Integrated Facade Engineering’ and ‘Grid-skin structures’ are discussed and illustrated through case studies of Tokyo-Tech campus buildings wherein seismic performance was enhanced sustainably while considering the environmental performance and aesthetics. In addition, a number of 360-degree videos of Tokyo Tech buildings provide learners with an immersive experience. The application of the grid-skin concept to RC buildings is discussed using shear walls and a two-layer framing system. Modern response control strategies to achieve immediate occupancy post-earthquake like rocking frame systems and seismic isolation in steel buildings are covered and practical considerations while adopting these systems are explained through the design of campus buildings. Grid shell systems and their unique seismic response characteristics are explained. The design of the metro station near campus was used to explain the practical and technical difficulties of designing lightweight roofs.

Concepts like ‘Integrated Facade Engineering’ and ‘Grid-skin structures’ are discussed and illustrated through case studies of Tokyo-Tech campus buildings wherein seismic performance was enhanced sustainably while considering the environmental performance and aesthetics. In addition, a number of 360-degree videos of Tokyo Tech buildings provide learners with an immersive experience. The application of the grid-skin concept to RC buildings is discussed using shear walls and a two-layer framing system. Modern response control strategies to achieve immediate occupancy post-earthquake like rocking frame systems and seismic isolation in steel buildings are covered and practical considerations while adopting these systems are explained through the design of campus buildings. Grid shell systems and their unique seismic response characteristics are explained. The design of the metro station near campus was used to explain the practical and technical difficulties of designing lightweight roofs.

Concepts like ‘Integrated Facade Engineering’ and ‘Grid-skin structures’ are discussed and illustrated through case studies of Tokyo-Tech campus buildings wherein seismic performance was enhanced sustainably while considering the environmental performance and aesthetics. In addition, a number of 360-degree videos of Tokyo Tech buildings provide learners with an immersive experience. The application of the grid-skin concept to RC buildings is discussed using shear walls and a two-layer framing system. Modern response control strategies to achieve immediate occupancy post-earthquake like rocking frame systems and seismic isolation in steel buildings are covered and practical considerations while adopting these systems are explained through the design of campus buildings. Grid shell systems and their unique seismic response characteristics are explained. The design of the metro station near campus was used to explain the practical and technical difficulties of designing lightweight roofs.

Concepts like ‘Integrated Facade Engineering’ and ‘Grid-skin structures’ are discussed and illustrated through case studies of Tokyo-Tech campus buildings wherein seismic performance was enhanced sustainably while considering the environmental performance and aesthetics. In addition, a number of 360-degree videos of Tokyo Tech buildings provide learners with an immersive experience. The application of the grid-skin concept to RC buildings is discussed using shear walls and a two-layer framing system. Modern response control strategies to achieve immediate occupancy post-earthquake like rocking frame systems and seismic isolation in steel buildings are covered and practical considerations while adopting these systems are explained through the design of campus buildings. Grid shell systems and their unique seismic response characteristics are explained. The design of the metro station near campus was used to explain the practical and technical difficulties of designing lightweight roofs.

Concepts like ‘Integrated Facade Engineering’ and ‘Grid-skin structures’ are discussed and illustrated through case studies of Tokyo-Tech campus buildings wherein seismic performance was enhanced sustainably while considering the environmental performance and aesthetics. In addition, a number of 360-degree videos of Tokyo Tech buildings provide learners with an immersive experience. The application of the grid-skin concept to RC buildings is discussed using shear walls and a two-layer framing system. Modern response control strategies to achieve immediate occupancy post-earthquake like rocking frame systems and seismic isolation in steel buildings are covered and practical considerations while adopting these systems are explained through the design of campus buildings. Grid shell systems and their unique seismic response characteristics are explained. The design of the metro station near campus was used to explain the practical and technical difficulties of designing lightweight roofs. Finally, the importance of collaboration between structural engineers and architects is discussed in a number of interviews between ETH Zurich’s Prof. L. Stalder, Tokyo Tech’s Prof. T.

Concepts like ‘Integrated Facade Engineering’ and ‘Grid-skin structures’ are discussed and illustrated through case studies of Tokyo-Tech campus buildings wherein seismic performance was enhanced sustainably while considering the environmental performance and aesthetics. In addition, a number of 360-degree videos of Tokyo Tech buildings provide learners with an immersive experience. The application of the grid-skin concept to RC buildings is discussed using shear walls and a two-layer framing system. Modern response control strategies to achieve immediate occupancy post-earthquake like rocking frame systems and seismic isolation in steel buildings are covered and practical considerations while adopting these systems are explained through the design of campus buildings. Grid shell systems and their unique seismic response characteristics are explained. The design of the metro station near campus was used to explain the practical and technical difficulties of designing lightweight roofs.

The course starts by introducing the progression of structural design from traditional timber buildings to the first steel high rise structures, metabolism movement and the evolution of modern spatial structures in Japan. Concepts like ‘Integrated Facade Engineering’ and ‘Grid-skin structures’ are discussed and illustrated through case studies of Tokyo-Tech campus buildings wherein seismic performance was enhanced sustainably while considering the environmental performance and aesthetics. In addition, a number of 360-degree videos of Tokyo Tech buildings provide learners with an immersive experience. The application of the grid-skin concept to RC buildings is discussed using shear walls and a two-layer framing system. Modern response control strategies to achieve immediate occupancy post-earthquake like rocking frame systems and seismic isolation in steel buildings are covered and practical considerations while adopting these systems are explained through the design of campus buildings. Grid shell systems and their unique seismic response characteristics are explained. The design of the metro station near campus was used to explain the practical and technical difficulties of designing lightweight roofs.

Concepts like ‘Integrated Facade Engineering’ and ‘Grid-skin structures’ are discussed and illustrated through case studies of Tokyo-Tech campus buildings wherein seismic performance was enhanced sustainably while considering the environmental performance and aesthetics. In addition, a number of 360-degree videos of Tokyo Tech buildings provide learners with an immersive experience. The application of the grid-skin concept to RC buildings is discussed using shear walls and a two-layer framing system. Modern response control strategies to achieve immediate occupancy post-earthquake like rocking frame systems and seismic isolation in steel buildings are covered and practical considerations while adopting these systems are explained through the design of campus buildings. Grid shell systems and their unique seismic response characteristics are explained. The design of the metro station near campus was used to explain the practical and technical difficulties of designing lightweight roofs.

The course starts by introducing the progression of structural design from traditional timber buildings to the first steel high rise structures, metabolism movement and the evolution of modern spatial structures in Japan. Concepts like ‘Integrated Facade Engineering’ and ‘Grid-skin structures’ are discussed and illustrated through case studies of Tokyo-Tech campus buildings wherein seismic performance was enhanced sustainably while considering the environmental performance and aesthetics. In addition, a number of 360-degree videos of Tokyo Tech buildings provide learners with an immersive experience. The application of the grid-skin concept to RC buildings is discussed using shear walls and a two-layer framing system. Modern response control strategies to achieve immediate occupancy post-earthquake like rocking frame systems and seismic isolation in steel buildings are covered and practical considerations while adopting these systems are explained through the design of campus buildings. Grid shell systems and their unique seismic response characteristics are explained. The design of the metro station near campus was used to explain the practical and technical difficulties of designing lightweight roofs.

The course starts by introducing the progression of structural design from traditional timber buildings to the first steel high rise structures, metabolism movement and the evolution of modern spatial structures in Japan. Concepts like ‘Integrated Facade Engineering’ and ‘Grid-skin structures’ are discussed and illustrated through case studies of Tokyo-Tech campus buildings wherein seismic performance was enhanced sustainably while considering the environmental performance and aesthetics. In addition, a number of 360-degree videos of Tokyo Tech buildings provide learners with an immersive experience. The application of the grid-skin concept to RC buildings is discussed using shear walls and a two-layer framing system. Modern response control strategies to achieve immediate occupancy post-earthquake like rocking frame systems and seismic isolation in steel buildings are covered and practical considerations while adopting these systems are explained through the design of campus buildings. Grid shell systems and their unique seismic response characteristics are explained. The design of the metro station near campus was used to explain the practical and technical difficulties of designing lightweight roofs.

Concepts like ‘Integrated Facade Engineering’ and ‘Grid-skin structures’ are discussed and illustrated through case studies of Tokyo-Tech campus buildings wherein seismic performance was enhanced sustainably while considering the environmental performance and aesthetics. In addition, a number of 360-degree videos of Tokyo Tech buildings provide learners with an immersive experience. The application of the grid-skin concept to RC buildings is discussed using shear walls and a two-layer framing system. Modern response control strategies to achieve immediate occupancy post-earthquake like rocking frame systems and seismic isolation in steel buildings are covered and practical considerations while adopting these systems are explained through the design of campus buildings. Grid shell systems and their unique seismic response characteristics are explained. The design of the metro station near campus was used to explain the practical and technical difficulties of designing lightweight roofs.

Concepts like ‘Integrated Facade Engineering’ and ‘Grid-skin structures’ are discussed and illustrated through case studies of Tokyo-Tech campus buildings wherein seismic performance was enhanced sustainably while considering the environmental performance and aesthetics. In addition, a number of 360-degree videos of Tokyo Tech buildings provide learners with an immersive experience. The application of the grid-skin concept to RC buildings is discussed using shear walls and a two-layer framing system. Modern response control strategies to achieve immediate occupancy post-earthquake like rocking frame systems and seismic isolation in steel buildings are covered and practical considerations while adopting these systems are explained through the design of campus buildings. Grid shell systems and their unique seismic response characteristics are explained. The design of the metro station near campus was used to explain the practical and technical difficulties of designing lightweight roofs.

The course starts by introducing the progression of structural design from traditional timber buildings to the first steel high rise structures, metabolism movement and the evolution of modern spatial structures in Japan. Concepts like ‘Integrated Facade Engineering’ and ‘Grid-skin structures’ are discussed and illustrated through case studies of Tokyo-Tech campus buildings wherein seismic performance was enhanced sustainably while considering the environmental performance and aesthetics. In addition, a number of 360-degree videos of Tokyo Tech buildings provide learners with an immersive experience. The application of the grid-skin concept to RC buildings is discussed using shear walls and a two-layer framing system. Modern response control strategies to achieve immediate occupancy post-earthquake like rocking frame systems and seismic isolation in steel buildings are covered and practical considerations while adopting these systems are explained through the design of campus buildings. Grid shell systems and their unique seismic response characteristics are explained. The design of the metro station near campus was used to explain the practical and technical difficulties of designing lightweight roofs. Finally, the importance of collaboration between structural engineers and architects is discussed in a number of interviews between ETH Zurich’s Prof. L. Stalder, Tokyo Tech’s Prof. T.

Concepts like ‘Integrated Facade Engineering’ and ‘Grid-skin structures’ are discussed and illustrated through case studies of Tokyo-Tech campus buildings wherein seismic performance was enhanced sustainably while considering the environmental performance and aesthetics. In addition, a number of 360-degree videos of Tokyo Tech buildings provide learners with an immersive experience. The application of the grid-skin concept to RC buildings is discussed using shear walls and a two-layer framing system. Modern response control strategies to achieve immediate occupancy post-earthquake like rocking frame systems and seismic isolation in steel buildings are covered and practical considerations while adopting these systems are explained through the design of campus buildings. Grid shell systems and their unique seismic response characteristics are explained. The design of the metro station near campus was used to explain the practical and technical difficulties of designing lightweight roofs. Finally, the importance of collaboration between structural engineers and architects is discussed in a number of interviews between ETH Zurich’s Prof. L. Stalder, Tokyo Tech’s Prof. T. Takeuchi and Prof. Y. Tsukamoto.",edX,Available for Paid verified track with cost $79 USD,5 weeks 1–3 hours per week,Course,"17,766 already enrolled!

Concepts like ‘Integrated Facade Engineering’ and ‘Grid-skin structures’ are discussed and illustrated through case studies of Tokyo-Tech campus buildings wherein seismic performance was enhanced sustainably while considering the environmental performance and aesthetics. In addition, a number of 360-degree videos of Tokyo Tech buildings provide learners with an immersive experience. The application of the grid-skin concept to RC buildings is discussed using shear walls and a two-layer framing system. Modern response control strategies to achieve immediate occupancy post-earthquake like rocking frame systems and seismic isolation in steel buildings are covered and practical considerations while adopting these systems are explained through the design of campus buildings. Grid shell systems and their unique seismic response characteristics are explained. The design of the metro station near campus was used to explain the practical and technical difficulties of designing lightweight roofs.

As scientists learn more about the pathways of disease, the causes of aging and the mechanisms by which exercise exerts its benefits, better strategies to slow (i.e. “hack”) the aging process have also emerged. The benefits of exercise impact nearly every area of health and disease that older individuals are concerned about including the risk for dementia, cardiovascular disease, stroke, musculoskeletal disorders, obesity, diabetes and more. Through a series of informative lectures, you will learn how your body normally changes with age and how physical activity can be used to slow that trajectory of aging.

The course starts by introducing the progression of structural design from traditional timber buildings to the first steel high rise structures, metabolism movement and the evolution of modern spatial structures in Japan. Concepts like ‘Integrated Facade Engineering’ and ‘Grid-skin structures’ are discussed and illustrated through case studies of Tokyo-Tech campus buildings wherein seismic performance was enhanced sustainably while considering the environmental performance and aesthetics. In addition, a number of 360-degree videos of Tokyo Tech buildings provide learners with an immersive experience. The application of the grid-skin concept to RC buildings is discussed using shear walls and a two-layer framing system. Modern response control strategies to achieve immediate occupancy post-earthquake like rocking frame systems and seismic isolation in steel buildings are covered and practical considerations while adopting these systems are explained through the design of campus buildings. Grid shell systems and their unique seismic response characteristics are explained. The design of the metro station near campus was used to explain the practical and technical difficulties of designing lightweight roofs.

Concepts like ‘Integrated Facade Engineering’ and ‘Grid-skin structures’ are discussed and illustrated through case studies of Tokyo-Tech campus buildings wherein seismic performance was enhanced sustainably while considering the environmental performance and aesthetics. In addition, a number of 360-degree videos of Tokyo Tech buildings provide learners with an immersive experience. The application of the grid-skin concept to RC buildings is discussed using shear walls and a two-layer framing system. Modern response control strategies to achieve immediate occupancy post-earthquake like rocking frame systems and seismic isolation in steel buildings are covered and practical considerations while adopting these systems are explained through the design of campus buildings. Grid shell systems and their unique seismic response characteristics are explained. The design of the metro station near campus was used to explain the practical and technical difficulties of designing lightweight roofs.

We have optimized the course settings for learning: instant feedback after trying problems and all content available at all times for self-paced progress. You receive feedback on correctness of answers, but the problem submissions do not count toward the grade for a certificate. Instead, we offer a thorough and robust means of certifying edX learners in their mastery of the MITx introductory biology content, through a the MITx 7.00x Introduction to Biology Competency Exam. This challenging option is available only to those who register for the verified-certificate track, and successful completion of this exam is the only assessment that counts toward a certificate. We highly recommend preparing for the Competency Exam certification by using the current course materials and MIT OpenCourseWare problems. The Competency Exam is offered in the last week of every course run.",edX,Available for Paid verified track with cost $150 USD,16 weeks 5–10 hours per week,Course,Starts Mar 12Ends Jun 25E,,,Biology & Life Sciences,"Eric S.

Concepts like ‘Integrated Facade Engineering’ and ‘Grid-skin structures’ are discussed and illustrated through case studies of Tokyo-Tech campus buildings wherein seismic performance was enhanced sustainably while considering the environmental performance and aesthetics. In addition, a number of 360-degree videos of Tokyo Tech buildings provide learners with an immersive experience. The application of the grid-skin concept to RC buildings is discussed using shear walls and a two-layer framing system. Modern response control strategies to achieve immediate occupancy post-earthquake like rocking frame systems and seismic isolation in steel buildings are covered and practical considerations while adopting these systems are explained through the design of campus buildings. Grid shell systems and their unique seismic response characteristics are explained. The design of the metro station near campus was used to explain the practical and technical difficulties of designing lightweight roofs.

As the barriers to daily movement have gotten stronger, the burden to exercise has gotten greater. These challenges are made worse for individuals in midlife and beyond who experience physical impairments or who are new to regular physical activity. As scientists learn more about the pathways of disease, the causes of aging and the mechanisms by which exercise exerts its benefits, better strategies to slow (i.e. “hack”) the aging process have also emerged. The benefits of exercise impact nearly every area of health and disease that older individuals are concerned about including the risk for dementia, cardiovascular disease, stroke, musculoskeletal disorders, obesity, diabetes and more. Through a series of informative lectures, you will learn how your body normally changes with age and how physical activity can be used to slow that trajectory of aging.

The course starts by introducing the progression of structural design from traditional timber buildings to the first steel high rise structures, metabolism movement and the evolution of modern spatial structures in Japan. Concepts like ‘Integrated Facade Engineering’ and ‘Grid-skin structures’ are discussed and illustrated through case studies of Tokyo-Tech campus buildings wherein seismic performance was enhanced sustainably while considering the environmental performance and aesthetics. In addition, a number of 360-degree videos of Tokyo Tech buildings provide learners with an immersive experience. The application of the grid-skin concept to RC buildings is discussed using shear walls and a two-layer framing system. Modern response control strategies to achieve immediate occupancy post-earthquake like rocking frame systems and seismic isolation in steel buildings are covered and practical considerations while adopting these systems are explained through the design of campus buildings. Grid shell systems and their unique seismic response characteristics are explained. The design of the metro station near campus was used to explain the practical and technical difficulties of designing lightweight roofs. Finally, the importance of collaboration between structural engineers and architects is discussed in a number of interviews between ETH Zurich’s Prof. L. Stalder, Tokyo Tech’s Prof. T.

Concepts like ‘Integrated Facade Engineering’ and ‘Grid-skin structures’ are discussed and illustrated through case studies of Tokyo-Tech campus buildings wherein seismic performance was enhanced sustainably while considering the environmental performance and aesthetics. In addition, a number of 360-degree videos of Tokyo Tech buildings provide learners with an immersive experience. The application of the grid-skin concept to RC buildings is discussed using shear walls and a two-layer framing system. Modern response control strategies to achieve immediate occupancy post-earthquake like rocking frame systems and seismic isolation in steel buildings are covered and practical considerations while adopting these systems are explained through the design of campus buildings. Grid shell systems and their unique seismic response characteristics are explained. The design of the metro station near campus was used to explain the practical and technical difficulties of designing lightweight roofs.

Concepts like ‘Integrated Facade Engineering’ and ‘Grid-skin structures’ are discussed and illustrated through case studies of Tokyo-Tech campus buildings wherein seismic performance was enhanced sustainably while considering the environmental performance and aesthetics. In addition, a number of 360-degree videos of Tokyo Tech buildings provide learners with an immersive experience. The application of the grid-skin concept to RC buildings is discussed using shear walls and a two-layer framing system. Modern response control strategies to achieve immediate occupancy post-earthquake like rocking frame systems and seismic isolation in steel buildings are covered and practical considerations while adopting these systems are explained through the design of campus buildings. Grid shell systems and their unique seismic response characteristics are explained. The design of the metro station near campus was used to explain the practical and technical difficulties of designing lightweight roofs.

These challenges are made worse for individuals in midlife and beyond who experience physical impairments or who are new to regular physical activity. As scientists learn more about the pathways of disease, the causes of aging and the mechanisms by which exercise exerts its benefits, better strategies to slow (i.e. “hack”) the aging process have also emerged. The benefits of exercise impact nearly every area of health and disease that older individuals are concerned about including the risk for dementia, cardiovascular disease, stroke, musculoskeletal disorders, obesity, diabetes and more. Through a series of informative lectures, you will learn how your body normally changes with age and how physical activity can be used to slow that trajectory of aging.

The course starts by introducing the progression of structural design from traditional timber buildings to the first steel high rise structures, metabolism movement and the evolution of modern spatial structures in Japan. Concepts like ‘Integrated Facade Engineering’ and ‘Grid-skin structures’ are discussed and illustrated through case studies of Tokyo-Tech campus buildings wherein seismic performance was enhanced sustainably while considering the environmental performance and aesthetics. In addition, a number of 360-degree videos of Tokyo Tech buildings provide learners with an immersive experience. The application of the grid-skin concept to RC buildings is discussed using shear walls and a two-layer framing system. Modern response control strategies to achieve immediate occupancy post-earthquake like rocking frame systems and seismic isolation in steel buildings are covered and practical considerations while adopting these systems are explained through the design of campus buildings. Grid shell systems and their unique seismic response characteristics are explained. The design of the metro station near campus was used to explain the practical and technical difficulties of designing lightweight roofs.

Concepts like ‘Integrated Facade Engineering’ and ‘Grid-skin structures’ are discussed and illustrated through case studies of Tokyo-Tech campus buildings wherein seismic performance was enhanced sustainably while considering the environmental performance and aesthetics. In addition, a number of 360-degree videos of Tokyo Tech buildings provide learners with an immersive experience. The application of the grid-skin concept to RC buildings is discussed using shear walls and a two-layer framing system. Modern response control strategies to achieve immediate occupancy post-earthquake like rocking frame systems and seismic isolation in steel buildings are covered and practical considerations while adopting these systems are explained through the design of campus buildings. Grid shell systems and their unique seismic response characteristics are explained. The design of the metro station near campus was used to explain the practical and technical difficulties of designing lightweight roofs.

The course starts by introducing the progression of structural design from traditional timber buildings to the first steel high rise structures, metabolism movement and the evolution of modern spatial structures in Japan. Concepts like ‘Integrated Facade Engineering’ and ‘Grid-skin structures’ are discussed and illustrated through case studies of Tokyo-Tech campus buildings wherein seismic performance was enhanced sustainably while considering the environmental performance and aesthetics. In addition, a number of 360-degree videos of Tokyo Tech buildings provide learners with an immersive experience. The application of the grid-skin concept to RC buildings is discussed using shear walls and a two-layer framing system. Modern response control strategies to achieve immediate occupancy post-earthquake like rocking frame systems and seismic isolation in steel buildings are covered and practical considerations while adopting these systems are explained through the design of campus buildings. Grid shell systems and their unique seismic response characteristics are explained. The design of the metro station near campus was used to explain the practical and technical difficulties of designing lightweight roofs. Finally, the importance of collaboration between structural engineers and architects is discussed in a number of interviews between ETH Zurich’s Prof. L. Stalder, Tokyo Tech’s Prof. T.

Modern approaches to seismic design and retrofit will be covered through case studies of some unique campus buildings in Tokyo. The course starts by introducing the progression of structural design from traditional timber buildings to the first steel high rise structures, metabolism movement and the evolution of modern spatial structures in Japan. Concepts like ‘Integrated Facade Engineering’ and ‘Grid-skin structures’ are discussed and illustrated through case studies of Tokyo-Tech campus buildings wherein seismic performance was enhanced sustainably while considering the environmental performance and aesthetics. In addition, a number of 360-degree videos of Tokyo Tech buildings provide learners with an immersive experience. The application of the grid-skin concept to RC buildings is discussed using shear walls and a two-layer framing system. Modern response control strategies to achieve immediate occupancy post-earthquake like rocking frame systems and seismic isolation in steel buildings are covered and practical considerations while adopting these systems are explained through the design of campus buildings. Grid shell systems and their unique seismic response characteristics are explained. The design of the metro station near campus was used to explain the practical and technical difficulties of designing lightweight roofs. Finally, the importance of collaboration between structural engineers and architects is discussed in a number of interviews between ETH Zurich’s Prof. L. Stalder, Tokyo Tech’s Prof. T.
